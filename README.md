# Alpine JS lessons for egghead.io

This project runs on `11ty`. To get it working, clone this repo, run `yarn` or `npm install`, and then `yarn start` or `npm run start`.

The homepage will have a link to each lesson.

There is an HTML file for each lesson, available in `src/_includes/lessons`.

This setup allows the lesson file to contain the lesson markup, and absolutely nothing else! ðŸ¤“

Happy learning!
